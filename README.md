# UNet Architecture

This project contains my code walking through the UNet paper and coding demo found here:
[UNet Coding Demo](https://nn.labml.ai/unet/index.html)

Link to the paper can be found here: 
[U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597v1)

## Overview

UNet is a convolutional neural network architecture designed for biomedical image segmentation. This repository contains an implementation of the UNet model, along with a detailed walkthrough based on the UNet paper and an accompanying coding demo.

## Contents

- `U-Net.py`: The main UNet model implementation.
- `main.py`: Script for training the UNet model on a dataset as well as loading the dataset.
- `utils.py`: Helper functions used throughout the project.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and its contents.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
